          <ul>
            <li> “Travelers, there is no path, paths are made by walking.” </li>
            <li> “Don't try to rush things: for the cup to run over, it must first be filled.” </li>
            <li> “In order to write poetry, you must first invent a poet who will write it.” </li>
            <li> “I thought my fire was out, and stirred the ashes… I burnt my fingers.” </li>        
            <li> “Between living and dreaming there is a third thing. Guess it.” </li>        
            <li> “I dreamt -- marvellous error! -- that I had a beehive here inside my heart. And the golden bees were making white combs and sweet honey from my old failures.” </li>      
            <li> Look for your other half who walks always next to you and tends to be who you aren't.” </li>
